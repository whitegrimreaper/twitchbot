This is a bot for my twitch channel

Using Golang because I'm a back-end engineer and as such I hate JS as much as it deserves.

## Current functions:
 - !pigeon
    - Insults pigeonmob

## Planned functionality:
 - integration with Streamlabs API to track donations and subscriptions
 - integration with ??? to track bits and possibly other ways of supporting
 - checking and controlling points gained from the above
 - spending those points (gonna keep this bit secret for a while just in case)
